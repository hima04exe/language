            February 21st is recognized as International Mother Language Day (IMLD) which is chosen to honor the tragic but revolutionary events of this day in 1952 in Bangladesh. This day is deeply significant for Bengali speakers, as it commemorates the sacrifice of students and activists who fought for the right to speak their mother tongue.After the Partition of India in 1947, the province of Bengal was divided. The western part remained in India, while the eastern part became East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). However, economic, cultural, and linguistic disparities between East and West Pakistan soon became evident. The ruling government, dominated by West Pakistan, wanted to enforce Urdu as the sole national language.Tensions peaked in 1948, when the government announced that Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. This decision ignored Bengali, which was spoken by the majority of the country's population—over 56% of the people. The people of East Pakistan strongly opposed this decision, as it was an attack on their identity, culture, and rights.

        <h2 class="h22">In response, the students and intellectuals from Dhaka University, Dhaka Medical College, and other institutions organized protests, demanding that Bengali be recognized as one of the national languages. The movement gained widespread support from people across the country, including politicians, poets, teachers, and ordinary citizens.The government, however, refused to listen and instead banned protests. They imposed Section 144, a law that prohibited public gatherings. But the people of East Pakistan were determined to fight for their rights.On February 21, 1952, students gathered near Dhaka University in a peaceful protest. They chanted slogans, carried banners, and demanded that their language be recognized. Suddenly, without warning, police opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators.Several young activists were killed on the spot, and many more were injured. These martyrs gave their lives for the right to speak in Bengali, and their sacrifice became the foundation of the language movement.The brave students who lost their lives included:</h2>

            After Bangladesh gained independence in 1971, February 21st was officially declared a national holiday, observed as Shaheed Dibosh (Martyrs’ Day). The movement was not just about language—it symbolized a struggle for cultural identity, democracy, and fundamental human rights. The sacrifice of the martyrs inspired future generations to stand up against oppression and fight for their rights.To honor this history on a global scale, UNESCO proclaimed February 21 as International Mother Language Day (IMLD) on November 17, 1999. The initiative was first proposed by Rafiqul Islam, a Bangladeshi-Canadian, who wrote to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 1998, urging the recognition of linguistic diversity and rights worldwide.The first official IMLD celebration took place on February 21, 2000, and since then, it has been observed across the world. In Bangladesh, people visit the Shahid Minar (Martyrs’ Monument) at dawn, offering floral tributes in memory of the fallen heroes. Educational institutions, cultural organizations, and various communities hold discussions, processions, and cultural programs to pay homage to the language martyrs. Beyond Bangladesh, IMLD serves as a reminder of the importance of linguistic diversity and the need to preserve endangered languages. Every year, UNESCO announces a theme that highlights different aspects of language preservation, multilingual education, and cultural inclusion. The legacy of the language movement continues to inspire people worldwide to protect their linguistic heritage and promote education in native languages, ensuring that no language is ever silenced again.</p>
